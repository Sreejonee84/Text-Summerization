# Text-Summerization
The exponential growth in the volume of documents available over internet.
Need of efficient information retrieval procedure to meet user's complex information need.
Automatic Text summarization may be the right choice to express the key idea by compressing the source text and represent it as summary.
.“A summary is a text that is produced from one or more texts, that contains a significant portion of the information in the original text(s), and that is no longer than half of the original text(s) and usually significantly less than that”.

There are several valid reasons in favor of the – automatic – summarization of documents. Here are just a few:
1)	Summaries reduce reading time. 
2)	When researching documents, summaries make the selection process easier. 
3)  Automatic summarization improves the effectiveness of indexing.
4)  Automatic summarization algorithms are less biased than human summarizers.
5)  Personalized summaries are useful in question-answering systems as they provide personalized information. 
6)  Using automatic or semi-automatic summarization systems enables commercial abstract services to increase the number of texts they are     able to process.
